# Open_Source_Attack_Visualization
In this section, we have considered dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IQTLabs/software-supply-chain-compromises/master/software_supply_chain_attacks.csv

and categorize attacks initiated from the open source project and other sources by REGEX matching.

Then we have calculated the number of attack initiated from the open source project and other sources. 

Then, we plot the data of the number of attack initiaed from the open source and other sources and show a 
visualization.
